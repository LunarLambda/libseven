# libseven

A fully from-scratch library for GBA development, meant to
replace existing libraries like libgba or libtonc.

It has the following key goals:

- A straightforward, consistent API covering the most common functionality
of the GBA hardware, as well as commonly needed utility functions.
- Optimize for speed where it matters, optimize for size everywhere else.
- Avoid pitfalls and hard to find bugs by being solid.
- Provide high-quality, accessible documentation.

## Implementation Status

## Build, Installation, Linking

## Documentation

is highly outdated as of now.

# Contributing
